    Function for copying files from one directory to another.

    REPLACE IN FILE
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Function for replacing strings in a file with others. 

    Parameters
    ----------
    filename : string. The name of the file where the strings will be 
        replaced.
    
    replacements : dictionary mapping strings to strings. The keys are the 
        strings to be replaced, and the values are the strings that will 
        replace the keys. Each key must have only one corresponding value. 

        For example, with replacements = {'hello': 'hola', '15': '42'} 
        every occurrence of 'hello' in the file will be replaced with 'hola', 
        and every occurrence '15' will be replaced with '42'.
    
    final_filename: string. The name that the modified file will have. If not
        specified, the original file will be overwritten.
