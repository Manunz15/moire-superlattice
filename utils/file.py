    Function for replacing strings in a file with others. 

    Parameters
    ----------
    filename : string. The name of the file where the strings will be 
        replaced.
    
    replacements : dictionary mapping strings to strings. The keys are the 
        strings to be replaced, and the values are the strings that will 
        replace the keys. Each key must have only one corresponding value. 

        For example, with replacements = {'hello': 'hola', '15': '42'}

        and every occurrence '15' will be replaced with '42'.

        start with 'filename: string. The name ect...', the previous lines
        will be deleted.
