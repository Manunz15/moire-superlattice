        REPLACE IN FILES
        -------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Function for replacing strings in a file with others. 

        Parameters
        ----------
        filename : string. The name of the file where the strings will be 
            replaced.
        
        replacements : dictionary of strings. The keys are the strings to be 
            replaced, and the values are the strings that will replace the keys.
            Each key must have only one corresponding value. 

            For example, with replacements = {'hello': 'hola', '15': '42'} 
            every occurrence of 'hello' in the file will be replaced with 'hola', 
            and every occurrence '15' will be replaced with '42'.
